To run this app i use the XAMPP Control Panel 3.2.4 and start a local HTTP server with Apache (2.4.43). i use phpmyadmin (5.0.2) to admin the db and i use MySQL too (10.4.11-MariaDB).
The PHP version is 7.4.6.
I use Smarty (3.1.34) to make a cleaner php & html code.
The file "routerClass.php" was not written by me. It was done by my college professors a while ago!
